// Spec: pawaac-design-language-evolution — Task 14 (Contact_Page route)
// Requirements: 1.1, 1.4, 4.1, 9.1
// Design: design.md -> Page Specifications -> Contact_Page
//
// Establishes the new, dedicated `/contact` route. The contact form is
// migrated here (restyled with the Uplink_Form shell) from the homepage
// anchor section — src/components/sections/Contact.tsx itself is left
// untouched and continues to render on the Homepage until task 16 removes
// it there. Content is composed from two new section components
// (ContactHero, ContactForm) built fresh for this route, per design.md's
// Contact_Page table. Persona ordering: both sections are tagged "Both",
// so the ordering constraint from Property 7 is trivially satisfied.
