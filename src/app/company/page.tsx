// Design: design.md -> Page Specifications -> Company_Page
//
// Establishes the new `/company` route. This is entirely net-new content —
// no existing homepage section covers a "company" narrative, so there is
// nothing to migrate here. Content is composed from three section
// components (Company hero, Mission & approach, Team / careers teaser)
// built fresh for this route, per design.md's Company_Page table.
//
// Persona ordering: all three sections are tagged "Both" — there is no
// Defense_Police_Persona or Enterprise_Persona-only section on this page,
// so the ordering constraint from Property 7 is trivially satisfied by
// rendering in table order.
