// Establishes the new `/careers` route. This is entirely net-new content —
// no existing homepage section covers a "careers" narrative, so there is
// nothing to migrate here. Content is composed from two section components
// (CareersHero, CareersApplicationForm) built fresh for this route, per
// design.md's Careers_Page table.
//
// Persona ordering: both sections are tagged "Both", so the ordering
// constraint from Property 7 is trivially satisfied by rendering in table
// order.
