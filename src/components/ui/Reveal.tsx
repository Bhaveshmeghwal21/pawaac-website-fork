// Spec: pawaac-design-language-evolution — Task 5 (Reveal_On_Scroll)
// Requirements: 9.8
// Design: design.md -> Shared Components -> Reveal_On_Scroll;
//         Reduced-Motion Fallback Matrix
//
// This is the pre-existing scroll-reveal component, extended in place rather
// than duplicated: its prop API (children, y, delay, className) is
// preserved so every existing call site (Contact.tsx, Traction.tsx, and the
// ~8 others) keeps working unchanged. The underlying technique combines a
// `clip-path: inset(...)` wipe with a small paired translateY + scale, both
// triggered once the element is judged to be in view, per the
// Reveal_On_Scroll spec.
// The clip-path wipe alone reads as a flat mask; pairing it with a short
// (<=14px) settle-in translate and a subtle scale gives revealed content a
// sense of physical weight/momentum instead of just unmasking in place.
//
// Trigger mechanism (bugfix): originally driven purely by framer-motion's
// `whileInView` prop. That has a known failure mode for content that is
// already in the viewport at first paint (e.g. the Homepage hero) when an
// ancestor has `overflow-hidden` and the element's own initial state is
// clip-path-clipped to zero visible area — some browsers'
// IntersectionObserver never reports an initial "intersecting" callback in
// that combination, so `once: true` never fires and the content stays
// permanently invisible (see HOMEPAGE_MISSING_PARTS.md's first item).
// Fixed by driving the reveal off framer-motion's `useInView` hook instead
// (same IntersectionObserver under the hood), plus a short safety-timeout
// fallback that force-reveals the content if the observer hasn't fired
// within 1.2s of mount regardless of cause — belt-and-suspenders against
// this exact class of bug recurring, and also the mechanism that covers
// environments where IntersectionObserver itself never fires at all.
//
// The `y` prop is repurposed from "initial pixel offset" to "reveal
// direction": its sign selects whether the clip-path wipe opens bottom-up
// (y >= 0, matching the old "enters from below" intent) or top-down (y < 0).
// Its magnitude no longer drives the clip-path itself, but is still used
// (clamped small) to size the paired settle-in translate distance below.
//
// Reduced-motion fallback (Requirement 9.8): when
// `usePrefersReducedMotion()` is true, this renders children directly in
// their final, fully-revealed state with no clip-path keyframe and no
// transform.
