// SkyScenery — site-owner-requested full-bleed decorative background
// (live visual-preview feedback, not gated by a Change_Proposal since it
// is pure decoration, no invented facts/numerals).
//
// Previously a purely CSS-built abstract sky (gradient bands, a soft
// "sun/moon" disc, blurred cloud blobs, scan-line texture). The site owner
// has now supplied a real sky photo and explicitly asked to "paste normal
// sky photo with perfect quality" now, in color, with the site owner
// manually converting it to black-and-white themselves later by swapping
// the file at public/images/skyimage2.jpg.
//
// TEMPORARY, SITE-OWNER-APPROVED EXCEPTION to Requirement 3.1-3.2 (strict
// achromatic/R=G=B palette): this is the one deliberate place in the site
// that intentionally renders a real, non-monochrome color photograph, and
// it is NOT desaturated/grayscale-filtered here on purpose — the owner
// wants "perfect quality" now and will replace this file with a
// black-and-white version manually on their end. Do NOT treat this as a
// compliance regression, and do NOT copy this real-photo-in-color
// treatment to any other component; every other photographic image in the
// site (SentrivionHero, HawkAIHero, etc.) keeps its `grayscale` filter.
//
// Requirement 10.6: purely decorative, aria-hidden and excluded from the
// tab order (pointer-events-none).
//
// Parallax drift: the photo now drifts slightly slower than page scroll
// (GSAP + ScrollTrigger, already wired up via LenisProvider for Lenis/GSAP
// sync but previously unused anywhere on the homepage) — a small
// translateY scrub tied to document scroll progress, capped well within
// the image's `fill` overscan so no letterboxing/edge gap is ever exposed.
// This is what actually sells cinematic depth for the site's dominant
// full-bleed backdrop; a perfectly static background reads flat by
// comparison to every foreground section animating on top of it.
// Gated behind `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` (Requirement 9.8): the
// ScrollTrigger is never created under reduced motion, so the layer stays
// completely static, matching every other motion component's fallback.
