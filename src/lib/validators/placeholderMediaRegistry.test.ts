//   "Every Placeholder_Media entry defined in this design has either a

// This is a fixed, non-generative unit/example test (per this design's
// Testing Strategy classification), not a property test. It transcribes
// every row from design.md's page-specification tables whose
// `Placeholder_Media` column is not "N/A" (rows marked N/A are data
// panels, forms, or preserved existing components — not PlaceholderMedia
// records at all, per design.md's PlaceholderMedia data model) into a
// fixture, then asserts each entry satisfies Requirement 5.2.
//
// Entries with an open Change_Proposal (real photography/imagery pending
// site-owner approval) are recorded with an empty `realAssetPaths` and
// their gating OCP id. Entries with no Change_Proposal are permanent,
// self-contained geometric/abstract treatments (not real photography
// awaiting approval) and are recorded with a non-empty `realAssetPaths`
// pointing at their in-repo generated treatment.
